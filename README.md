# Pokemon TCG Deck Builder
 Capstone project for PDX Codeguild 
 
 ## Project Overview
An app to virtually organize a model of the pokemon cards in your physical inventory. The user will be able to search, retreieve, and save pokemon cards by name, TCG id, and set. I will be building the app using the Pokemon API https://https://api.pokemontcg.io/v2/ and pokemon developers portal:https://docs.pokemontcg.io/getting-started/migration. The idea is to provide a means for a collectors to save pokemon cards into a database for inventory management. Now you can take all your pokemon cards put in a card protector and trading case; whilst maintaining inventory online. 

## Features
Inventory management is messy. Allow for convenient storage whilst maintaining record of your personal inventory on your computer or smart device. Simply, logon to your secure account and search millions of pokemon cards and create your pokemon deck for inventory access.
