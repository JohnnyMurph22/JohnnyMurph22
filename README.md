# Photo Album Organizer 
 Capstone project for PDX Codeguild 
 
 ## Project Overview
 An app to organize and compose a photo album based on client, date, event, and location. Additionally, assist in searching, retrieving, migrating, and deleting photos. I will be building the app using the Dropbox API https://www.dropbox.com/developers. The idea is to provide a means for a photographer to extend his dropbox info for his clients to upload photos of an event to one universal repository, where the photographer can edit. The app will aide in organizing all the photos by key variables to allow for ease of retrieval, editing, and constituting client-event organized photo albums. 
 
## Features
Event photographers can't possibly capture every moment. Nowadays, we all have smart phones with integrated cameras. Allow event attendees to drop all their photos into a central repository where a professional photographer can edit and organize into albums you'll want to remember forever.
